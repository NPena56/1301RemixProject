        <h1>Why This Project Started</h1>
        <p>I started this projetc for my Technical Communications class.
            I quickly became aware that this project can become much more than
            <br> a regular project. This can become a space where people like me can come and learn. 
            Soon I hope to make it into a space <br> where people can also talk by gicing problems and solutions along with submitting their own video suggestions.
        </p>
