        <h2>
            I wrote this with the intention of hearing perspectives from other people,<br>
            I have always been fancianted by the idea that other people live their own<br>
            lives and people have the same experiences everywhere. <br> 
            Another topic being Nepotism something that alot of people deal with,<br> 
            so I would like to hear your response here.
